Torus
=======

This is a very stripped-down version of Paul McMillan and Walter
Dehnen's ``Torus`` code. It only includes the ``Torus`` engine,
without any main functions, potentials, or unnecessary utilities and
dependencies. It's main purpose is to serve as a version of the
``Torus`` code that can be included in
[galpy](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy).
